# A-Number-of-States-in-DFA-Calculator
Calculates a pattern of numbers from the congruence mod x in base y as well as a number of states in DFA.
Based on DFA calculation theory from professor William Gasarch's class.

<h2>Example</h2>
Mod 8 in base 10

1,2,4,0
10^0 mod 8 = 1
10^1 mod 8 = 2
10^2 mod 8 = 4
10^3 mod 8 = 0
10^4 mod 8 = 1
.
.
.
[1, 2, 4, 0] pattern
#pattern * mode = 4 * 8 = 32 = number of states in DFA

<h2>How to Test </h2>

congruence mod x in base y then

filename y x 

[ pattern numbers]
#number of states in DFA
