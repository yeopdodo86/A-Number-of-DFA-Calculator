# A-Number-of-States-in-DFA-Calculator
Calculates a pattern of numbers from the congruence mod x in base y as well as a number of states in DFA. Based on the DFA calculation theory from professor William Gasarch's theory of computation class. 

<h2>Example</h2>
Mod 8 in base 10

1,2,4,0<br>
10^0 mod 8 = 1<br>
10^1 mod 8 = 2<br>
10^2 mod 8 = 4<br>
10^3 mod 8 = 0<br>
10^4 mod 8 = 1<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
[1, 2, 4, 0] pattern<br>
#pattern * mode = 4 * 8 = 32 = number of states in DFA<br>

<h2>How to Test </h2>

congruence mod x in base y then

filename y x 

[ pattern numbers]
#number of states in DFA
